    ## Welcome to the Plant Disease Recognition System!
    Utilize cutting-edge **Transfer Learning** techniques with pre-trained models like **ResNet50**, **VGG16**, and our custom **CNN** model to identify plant diseases accurately.
    
    ### ðŸŒŸ Features:
    - **Transfer Learning:** Using state-of-the-art models to detect diseases quickly.
    - **Accurate Diagnosis:** Leveraging advanced neural networks trained on a vast dataset.
    - **Easy to Use:** Upload a plant image and get results in seconds!

    ### ðŸ“– How It Works:
    1. Go to the **Disease Recognition** page.
    2. Upload an image of the plant.
    3. Choose a pre-trained model (ResNet50, VGG16, or CNN).
    4. Get disease predictions and recommended actions.

    ### Get Started!

    ### ðŸŒ¿ Project Overview
    This project aims to leverage the power of **Transfer Learning** using pre-trained models like **ResNet50**, **VGG16**, and a custom **CNN** model to identify plant diseases accurately.
    
    ### ðŸ“Š Dataset Information
    The dataset includes over 87,000 RGB images categorized into 38 classes of healthy and diseased plants.

    ### ðŸ¤– Models Used
    - **ResNet50**: A 50-layer deep convolutional neural network known for its residual connections.
    - **VGG16**: A 16-layer deep neural network focusing on simplicity with smaller convolutional filters.
    - **CNN**: A custom Convolutional Neural Network trained specifically for plant disease recognition.

    ### Why Use Transfer Learning?
    Transfer Learning allows us to use pre-trained models to:
    - Save computational resources.
    - Achieve high accuracy with a smaller dataset.
    - Benefit from models already trained on large datasets like ImageNet.

    ### Project Goals
    1. Efficiently detect plant diseases.
    2. Provide a user-friendly interface for farmers and researchers.
    3. Promote agricultural health and productivity.
